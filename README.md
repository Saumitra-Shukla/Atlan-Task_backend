# Introduction

**Task State Manager** is an implementation of an upload/download system in which the functionality of pausing/resuming/terminating the task at hand is poosible.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

- We want to offer an implementation through which the user can stop the long-running task at any given point in time, and can choose to resume or terminate it. This will ensure that the resources like compute/memory/storage/time are used efficiently at our end, and do not go into processing tasks that have already been stopped (and then to roll back the work done post the stop-action)

## üöß Technology Stack

- **Framework** - Django Rest Framework
- **Database** - PostgreSQL
- **Python** - version 3.8.2

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation and Run with docker

# navigate to the project's directory and install all the relevant dev-dependencies
$ cd Atlan-Challenge---Long-Running-Task-Manager 

# Run
$ docker-compose up -d --build

# Then Run
$ docker-compose exec web python ./runningTask/manage.py migrate

# üí° Approach

### Upload

- A dummy CSV file is read using pandas and added row by row to a table in database.
  #### Pause
  Number of lines read are constantly being recorded, when paused an Interrupt Exception is raised which stops the upload.
  #### Resume
  The upload start funtion is called again but this time the CSV file is read from the checkpoint that we stored earlier.
  ### Terminate
  In this situation, the application needed to get back to the work done before this wrong upload started, so I dropped this particular table.
  ### Progress
  Some basic maths is being used to calculate the percentage of upload completed.

### Download/Export

- A database tabke from the server can be exported as a CSV file.
  #### Pause
  Number of lines read are constantly being recorded, when paused an Interrupt Exception is raised which stops the export.
  #### Resume
  The download start funtion is called again but this time the database table is read from the checkpoint that we stored earlier.
  ### Terminate
  In this situation, the application needed to get back to the work done before this wrong upload started, so I removed the exported CSV file.
  ### Progress
  Some basic maths is being used to calculate the percentage of download completed.
